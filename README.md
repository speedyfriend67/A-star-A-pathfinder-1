# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project implements an A* pathfinding algorithm visualization in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element. A* is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in computer science and is often applied to games and robotics.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the grid cells to create obstacles or walls.
3. The green circle represents the start point, and the red circle represents the end point.
4. The algorithm will calculate the shortest path around the obstacles.
5. Observe the visualization of the algorithm's progress and the final path.

## Features

- Interactive grid for drawing obstacles.
- Real-time visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
- Start and end points for defining the path.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and enhance the project:

- Adjust the grid size and canvas dimensions.
- Add additional features such as weighted edges or diagonal movement.
- Experiment with different heuristics for the A* algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
